    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is our most perfect chocolate brownie recipe. It's everything you want in a brownie – fudgy, dark and chocolatey. Serve these brownies warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and you'll understand what happiness is.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>225g/8oz butter (preferably unsalted)</li>
        <li>450g/1lb caster sugar</li>
        <li>140g/5oz dark chocolate, broken into pieces</li>
        <li>5 free-range medium eggs</li>
        <li>110g/4oz plain flour</li>
        <li>55g/2oz cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5. 
            Line a 20x30cm/8x12in baking tin with baking paper.</li>
        <li>Gently melt the butter and the sugar together in a large pan. 
            Once melted, take off the heat and add the chocolate. 
            Stir until melted.</li>
        <li>Beat in the eggs, 
            then stir in the flour and the cocoa powder.</li>
        <li>Pour the brownie batter into the prepared tin and bake 
            for 30–35 minutes, or until the top of the brownie is 
            just firm but there is still a gentle wobble 
            in the middle.</li>
        <li>Take out of the oven and leave to cool in the tin. 
            Cut the brownies into 5cm/2in squares when only just warm, 
            or completely cool.</li>
    </ol>
