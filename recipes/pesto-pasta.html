    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 mall waxy potatoes, peeled and very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>100g/3½oz extra fine green beans</li>
        <li>250g/9oz fresh tagliatelle</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the pesto:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>150g/5½oz basil leaves</li>
        <li>75g/2½oz pine nuts</li>
        <li>100g/3½oz Parmesan cheese, or an alternative vegetarian hard cheese, freshly grated</li>
        <li>5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Blanch the potatoes and green beans in boiling water for 2 minutes. Drain under cold running water and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a pestle and mortar, crush the garlic with half a teaspoon sea salt until you have a smooth paste. Add the basil leaves and pound until the leaves turn to a pulp. Add the pine nuts and crush until smooth. Add 3 tablespoons of water to emulsify the mixture, then add the Parmesan cheese. Slowly work in the olive oil, until you have a drizzling consistency.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of boiling salted water to the boil, add cook the pasta with the blanched potatoes and green beans for about 3 minutes – the pasta should still have a bite.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, warm half of the pesto in a frying pan.</li>
        <li>Using tongs, lift the pasta, green beans and potatoes from the water and add to the frying pan. Toss with the pesto and add 2–3 tablespoons of the pasta water to loosen the sauce so it coats the pasta strands.</li>
        <li>Check the seasoning and divide the pasta between two bowls. Serve with the remaining pesto spooned over the top.</li>
